The following project concerns estimation of end of season save percentages from a sample of 10-15 games early in the season. We aim to show that Stein-Esimators are better than the MLE in this case. See JS_FinalDraft.pdf for the full write-up and hockeyStatsnew.R for R source code. 

The project was awarded second place in the Undergraduate Statistics Class Project Competition by CAUSE (Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraudate Statistics Education). The write-up for the project can also be found at their website:  https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/sites/default/files/usclap/2018-1/Predicting_Save_Percentage_for_NHL_Goalies_with_James-Stein_Estimation.pdf .
